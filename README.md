## Overview

I made this Chrome extension because the one I used in my first two years at Vanderbilt is outdated. Luckily, I realized that this project would be the perfect opportunity to apply my CS skills to something that would be helpful.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

As my first project using CSS and HTML, I learned a lot about coding with these tools. One of the major things I learned to do with a real project that I didn't learn in tutorials was using Inspect Element to debug my code. That was a lifesaver!


### Continued development

I want to continue working on the containers and figuring out a more uniform way to group them. I also want to improve the UI of the extension. 

### Useful resources
